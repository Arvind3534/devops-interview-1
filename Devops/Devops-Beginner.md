what is Devops ?
DevOps is an approach to collaborate the development and operations teams for a better, bug-free continuous delivery and integration of the source code.
DevOps is about automating the entire SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) process with the implementation of CI/CD practices.

CI/CD are the Continuous integration and continuous deployment methodologies.
Every source code check-in will automatically build and unit test the entire code against a
production like environment and continuously deployed to production environment after it passes its automated tests.
That eliminates the long feedback, bug-fix, and product enhancements loops between every
Release.

Every team takes the accountability of the entire product right from the requirement analysis to documentation to coding, testing in development environments, code deployment and continuous improvements in terms of bugs and feedback from reviewers and the customers.
