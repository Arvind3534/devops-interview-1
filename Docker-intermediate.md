### 1. What are containers?
```sh
A container is a standalone unit of software that packages together applications with all its dependencies and configurations. Containers help in abstracting applications from the computing environment in which they run.  Containers help in running the applications correctly in various computing environments. This helps to resolve the biggest problem “ It doesn’t work in my system. Multiple containers in an isolated manner can co-exist in a host system. All containers share the common host operating system. Thus making the containers lightweight and more preferable than virtual machines.

Detaching applications from its environment helps container-based applications to be deployed faster and on any on-premise systems or cloud. Developers with the help of containers can now concentrate on how to develop an application rather than how to run an application on different environments.IT operations teams focus on deployment and management rather than with application details such as specific software versions and configurations. Main competitors for containers are the virtual machines. Virtual machines are not lightweight compared to containers.

Containerization as a strategy is used as a practice across digital transformation due to its capability to bring a DevOps culture. The Dockerfile which defines the configuration of the image also acts as Infra as code up to some extent. Thus enabling teams to abstract their infrastructure in the form of code.
